# AlignTheMap

A mini-app to align polygons on the World Map. Polygons might be generated using [GreenMap](https://github.com/TotoShampoin/greenmap)

[You can test it here](https://totoshampoin.github.io/AlignTheMap/)

## How to use

- Locate the area you want to map polygons on (with the inputs below)
- Import the polygons (a json file) with the \[ \] button
- Place the 3 points of the frame wherever you want
  - You can also hold [Shift] to select multiple points, making it easier to manipulate
  - If you know linear algebra, think of the 3 points as an origin and 2 vectors (forming a transform matrix)
- \[Unavailable\] Click the download button to download the result as a GeoJSON
